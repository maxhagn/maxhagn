# Hi I'm max!
I am a software developer from Vienna and I currently study computer science at the technical university in Vienna. I am interested in all disciplines of computer science, but most of all in low level programming like compiler construction and development with C and C++.

My repositories are either tasks I had to solve in school or university or private projects. Here you can find an overview of my repositories:
