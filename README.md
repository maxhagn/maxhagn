# Hi there, I'm Max!
## I'm where technology meets business, transforming complex ideas into innovative solutions.
I am a computer science student at the Vienna University of Technology. As a software developer, I specialize in low level programming using C and C++. I have a passion for crafting efficient and reliable code, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems that require a deep understanding of how computers work. In my free time, I like to stay up to date on the latest developments in the tech industry and expand my skillset through self-study and experimentation. I am excited to share my projects and collaborate with others on GitHub while continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
